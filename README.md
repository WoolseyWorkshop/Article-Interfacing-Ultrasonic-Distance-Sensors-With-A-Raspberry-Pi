# Interfacing Ultrasonic Distance Sensors With A Raspberry Pi Article Resources
This repository contains resources related to the [Interfacing Ultrasonic Distance Sensors With A Raspberry Pi](https://www.woolseyworkshop.com/2020/05/01/interfacing-ultrasonic-distance-sensors-with-a-raspberry-pi/) article published on [WoolseyWorkshop.com](https://www.woolseyworkshop.com).

## [hcsr04_simple.py](hcsr04_simple.py)
A Python program that reads an HC-SR04, or compatible, ultrasonic distance sensor using the GPIO Zero library on a Raspberry Pi. Distance values are printed to the screen.

## [hcsr04_range.py](hcsr04_range.py)
A Python program that reads an HC-SR04, or compatible, ultrasonic distance sensor using the GPIO Zero library on a Raspberry Pi. It detects and prints whether an object was detected within or outside of a particular range.

## [hcsr04_array.py](hcsr04_array.py)
A Python program that reads an array of HC-SR04, or compatible, ultrasonic distance sensors using the GPIO Zero library on a Raspberry Pi. It also provides the ability to specify the sensor sampling rate in Hz.
